I'm a student in the artifical intelligence Master in Computer Engineering at Università degli Studi di Padova. I'm passionate about artificial intelligence, deep learning and reinforcement learning.

I have been programming since I was 15 years old. I graduated with honors in the Information Engineering Bachelor's at the Univiersità degli Studi di Padova.

Sometimes I tutor university and high schools students to help them prepare for exams, I mainly teach programming, data structures and algorithms and mathematics.
