In the summer of 2024 I got invited by one of my university professors to partecipate in the summer school BOOST24 held in Bologna, in this eleven days we attended many lectures by professors coming from universities all over the world. 

My favourite lectures I attended at BOOST were:

### **Hilbert, Gödel, Turing: Computers 'R' Us by professor Alessandro Panconesi** from Sapienza Università di Roma.

In this series of lectures professor Panconesi went over the historical context behind the Hilbert Program, the project birthed in the 1900s by David Hilbert that tried to formalize the whole of mathematics starting from a finite complete set of fundamental axioms. Then the lecturer explained to us the negative answers that proved Hilbert's program impossible: Turing's answer to the Entscheidungsproblem and Godel's incompleteness theorem. These lectures were incredibly interesting and showed us how much mathematics has changed in the last 100 years. These lectures also sparked many interesting conversation at dinner time with the other students attending. 


### **Machine Learning for the Rest of Us by professor Keshav Pingali** from University of Texas at Austin.

Professor Pingali explained to us reinforcement learning starting from the very basics of ML, Deep Learning and finally arriving to reinforcement learning. Explaining Markov Decision Processes and how to solve the full RL problem, taking the point of view of optimal control.
