During the Summer school BOOST 24 I attended in Bologna ([Read the BOOST post here]({{< relref "boost.md" >}})
) professor Alessandro Panconesi told us about a fall school he would be attending later this year called BUCA 24, in which engineers from Google would be giving lectures about various interesting topics. I decided to apply and I got accepted!

During this fall school we stayed in the beautiful island of San Servolo in Venice and we attended lectures about various techniqes that are used at Google to make their products better:
* Speculation, caching and LoRA in Transformers based deep learning models
* Load Balancing with consistent hashing
* System design to ensure reliability and efficiency of systems with billions of users
* Paxos algorithms for consensus in distributed systems

The lectures were held by:
- Dan Ardelean, Area Tech Lead for Search Infrastructure, VP of Engineering at Google
- JJ Furman, engineer at Google and the founder and creator of Megastore, the storage system used by Gmail and Drive
- Amer Diwan, Area Tech Lead for Performance and Capacity for Search Infrastructure at Google
