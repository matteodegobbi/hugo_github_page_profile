This May I partecipatd at [HackUPC 2025](https://hackupc.com/), an hackhathon organized by FIB in Barcelona.

Together with [Vojtěch](https://vojtechbestak.cz/), we built a reinforcement learning agent that learns to play a game similar to Geometry Dash's rocket section.
The agent is trained using deep Q-Learning and we built the game using pygame.
