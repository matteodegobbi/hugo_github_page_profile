This June I took part in the Digital Skills Cup AI Pro 2025, an online trivia competition about AI and Deep Learning hosted by LLPA. I got first place in the national qualification and then I also got first place in the world competition!



I won a prize of 3000$ to use to travel abroad fully paid by LLPA.

I visited Crete with my girlfriend, we had a lot of fun and it was a very entertaining experience participating in this competition.
